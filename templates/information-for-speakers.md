## Pitch ##

Our seminars are usually pretty well-attended by people with a wide-range of information security backgrounds (networks, systems, social aspects, access control, smart cards, cryptography, …). However, we do encourage specialised talks over general overviews. This is, after all, our research seminar.

## Time ##

Our seminars are typically 50 minutes, with a 40 minute talk and 10 minutes Q&A afterwards. However, how they split up you time is, of course, up to you.

Our seminars are usually at 11:00 am on a Thursday with lunch afterwards.
